ana_code contains my code for doing regression in Spark and the raw data sets in case you need them. Mainly I do four regressions in spark, and you could follow my code line by line to replicate my work directly. At the end of each regression, I use print to get the value I want.

etl_code contains my MR method for cleaning the data. The screenshots inside it show my results of implementation.
